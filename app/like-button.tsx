// Event handlers

// While it's common to use Server Actions within <form> elements, they can also be invoked with event handlers such as onClick. For example, to increment a like count:

'use client'
 
import { incrementLike } from './actions'
import { useState } from 'react'
 
export default function LikeButton({ initialLikes }: { initialLikes: number }) {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes)
 
  return (
    <>
      <p>Total Likes: {likes}</p>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const updatedLikes = await incrementLike()
          setLikes(updatedLikes)
        }}
      >
        Like
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
